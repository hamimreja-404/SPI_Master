SPI Protocol 
SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface. It is a protocol that is synchronous serial communication. It 
is used to communicate between the peripheral devices i.e. input and output devices and 
microcontrollers. It is allowed to transfer high-speed data. It is popular with digital communication 
applications and embedded systems. SPI can transfer the data and receive data from one device to 
another device at a time. 
â€¢ Components of SPI 
Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is the process of synchronous serial communication protocol. It is 
mainly used for connecting the microcontrollers to peripheral devices like sensors, displays, and 
memory chips. It facilitates the full-duplex, synchronous serial communication between one or more 
slave devices and a microcontroller. 
o Master Device: The master device is nothing but it controls the process of transformation of 
data on the SPI bus. It controls the data flow and it generates the clock signal. In most of the 
applications, the master device is the microcontroller or specialized SPI controller. 
o Slave Device: Slave devices are peripheral devices that are connected to the SPI bus and 
controlled by master devices. Every slave device has a different slave select (SS) line, allowing 
the master to select which device it wants to communicate with.
